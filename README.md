# PeopleMath

## Introduction

This is a web application designed to help managers plan how teams will spend their time, particularly in situations where there is an aim to split the team's resources between several independently-prioritised "buckets" of work in a certain ratio.

The fundamental entity in PeopleMath is the *period*, which can be any length of time you want to plan for your team. For each period, planners are expected to enter:

* What *objectives* are you considering working on during this period, in each bucket?
* How much (in whatever unit of resources you prefer to use) do you think each objective would require to complete?
* What is the relative priority order of the objectives, within each bucket?
* How much (of your resource units) do you expect each person on your team to have available during the period?
* How much of each person's available resources do you intend to allocate to each objective?

The tool aims to make it easy for users to see how the team is expected to spend its time, the assumptions (e.g. priority stack-ranking) that led to that decision, and what level of confidence they should have in the completion of each objective.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Features

### Commitment types

The tool supports a distinction between "committed" and "aspirational" objectives:

* A *committed* objective is one which your team is making a firm promise to complete within the period; perhaps some other team or a customer is depending on it.
* An *aspirational* objective is one you would like to achieve if possible, but something you would be willing to sacrifice for a committed objective if necessary.

It's generally a good idea to keep an eye on the fraction of your team's resources allocated to committed objectives. Too little, and your team is promising too little to its stakeholders; too much, and you are at risk of breaking your promises, as there is nothing you can safely drop if you find yourself behind on a committed objective. PeopleMath allows you to set a target "commit ratio", and tells you how your plan compares to that target.

### Summary view

There is a read-only "period summary" view that shows which objectives are committed, aspirational and rejected in each bucket. This is useful for sharing with stakeholders, as it will always stay up-to-date with your plan.

### Grouping and tagging

Sometimes it is helpful to work at a less granular level than individual objectives.

For example, when working with more senior stakeholders to prioritise work, it may be helpful to group objectives together, for example by project, so users can easily see how a team's resources are being split between projects, and discuss priorities at a higher level.

For this use case, PeopleMath supports arbitrary grouping for objectives. Each objective can be marked with a set of key-value pairs, e.g. `project:X, program:Y`. For each key, you will then get a breakdown of objectives by the values, both on the right-hand side of the main period view and in the "period summary" view. The latter allows the individual objectives to be toggled on and off, and also allows you to toggle between a stack-ranked per-bucket view and an aggregate view across all buckets (in descending order of resources allocated, since objectives from different buckets cannot be compared in priority by definition).

It is also useful to be able to mark objectives with particular themes. For this, PeopleMath supports tagging: each objective can be marked with a list of tags, e.g. `KeepTheLightsOn, TechDebtReduction`. For each tag, you get a breakdown of the objectives marked with that tag.

Groups are a mutually-exclusive concept: for a single grouping key, each objective is a member of at most one group. Tags, by contrast, have a free many-to-many relationship with objectives.

### Permissions

Thanks to contributions from [Samrthi](https://github.com/Samrthi), it is possible to configure PeopleMath so that read and write access is limited to certain users.

Users are identified using [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). Currently, the only underlying authentication method supported is [Google Sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web).

Users can be granted permissions individually (e.g. "allow Alice to write team X") or by the domain of their verified email address (e.g. "let anyone with a verified @google.com email address read team Y").

Permissions to read the list of teams, or add a new team, are app-wide and live in the `GeneralPermissions` on the stored `Settings` object. Permissions to read and write data associated with specific teams are stored in each `Team` object under `Permissions`.

This feature is not yet quite complete: we do not yet have any functionality in the user interface to edit permissions. The only way to do this currently is by editing the settings or the team JSON manually.

The authentication functionality is disabled by default. To turn it on:

* Create a Firebase project in [the Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and register your web app in it
* Add your web application's domain to the OAuth redirect domains list in the Firebase console (to get there: Firebase Console -> Authentication section -> Sign in method tab)
* [Download your Firebase config](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592#web) and copy the configuration object into `src/environments/firebaseConfig.ts`
* Set `requireAuth` to `true` in `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
* [Download your Firebase credentials](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk) and export them via `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/credentials.json"` (do NOT check these into version control)
* Run the backend with `--authmode firebase`

## Implementation

The front end was built using [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io). The API server in the `backend` directory was written in [Go](https://golang.org).

The whole application was designed to run on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/), using [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) for persistence, though the front-end could be deployed with a back-end that used an entirely different persistence mechanism or runtime platform.

Storage functionality is abstracted in the backend using the `StorageService` interface.

The permissions functionality uses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). This is abstracted in the back-end using the `Auth` interface, but substituting a different authentication system into the front-end would be more difficult.

## Development

### Local machine

The easiest way to work on the front end is to use the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) (`ng serve`, `ng test` etc), after an `npm install` to install the dependencies.

In development mode, the CLI will [proxy](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) API requests to a backend running on `localhost:8080`. To run the backend server locally, install the [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.12 or later), run `go build` in the `backend` directory, and run the resulting `peoplemath` binary. (You can do `go run .` in the `backend` directory as a shortcut to compile and run the backend in a single command.)

The simplest way to run it is with `peoplemath --inmemstore`, which will use a simple in-memory implementation of the API. This has no external dependencies, but data written will not survive a restart of the API server.

To persist the API data and exercise the Cloud Datastore persistence layer, the [Cloud Datastore emulator](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator) can be used: install and start the emulator, then set the environment variables according to the instructions, set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable, and run `peoplemath` with no arguments.

The front-end tests can be run via `ng test`, and the back-end tests via `go test` in the `backend` directory.

By default, the permissions functionality is turned off. If you would like to test it using the in-memory datastore, follow the general instructions for turning on authentication above, and use the `--inmemstore` flag along with `--defaultdomain your.domain`. This `defaultdomain` will be granted both read and write access to all parts of the application, while users from other domains will be denied.

### Using Docker

An alternative way of running PeopleMath using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) has been contributed by GitHub user [vavilen84](https://github.com/vavilen84) (thank you!). This will benefit developers who like to use Docker tooling. This is community-supported and not actively maintained by anyone at Google.

Configuration for this lives in the `docker` folder. Currently, there is no configuration here suitable for production use, as the frontend container uses the Angular CLI, which is not designed to be a production-quality web server.

In order to use this workflow for development, you must first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then, you can run PeopleMath by `cd`ing into the project's `docker/dev` folder and running `docker-compose up`. You should then be able to access PeopleMath on `localhost:4200`.

To stop the project, run `docker-compose down`.

### Continuous build

The project has a continuous build that uses [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/). Pull requests will not be accepted until this continuous build passes.

The build uses the `Dockerfile` in the root of the project. It uses a base image which was constructed using the `Dockerfile` in the `build` directory.

To reproduce the behaviour of the continuous build, first construct the base image using `docker build -t peoplemath-build-base -f build/Dockerfile build`. Then replace the `FROM` clause of the root `Dockerfile` with `FROM peoplemath-build-base`, and run `docker build -t peoplemath-build .` from the root of the project.

If you wish to run the build on Google Cloud Build using your own resources, follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-build?hl=en#build_using_dockerfile) using one of your own projects. Run `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/peoplemath-base` from inside the `build` folder to generate the base image, then substitute that tag into the `FROM` clause in the root `Dockerfile`, and run `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/peoplemath` from the root of the project to run the build.

## Deployment to App Engine

The primary supported way of running PeopleMath in a staging or production configuration is on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/). To deploy the app to App Engine:

* Create a Google Cloud project as described in [the quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/quickstart)
* Run `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`
* Run `build_appengine.sh` or equivalent commands to build the front-end and generate the `appengine_dist` directory
* `cd appengine_dist` and `gcloud app deploy`
